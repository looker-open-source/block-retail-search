### Block Structure

**Dashboards** - Due to the nature in which this data is displayed, this Block only exposes Dashboards as starting points for exploration, rather than using individual "Explore" pages. Start from a dashboard, then drill into any tile to start free-form exploration.


### Implementation Instructions / Customizations ##
